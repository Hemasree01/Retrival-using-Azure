# Retrival-using-Azure
## Use Case: Q&A from Uploaded PDF Documents
- This project implements a RAG-based solution focused on extracting knowledge from PDF documents uploaded by users. The goal is to enable users to:
1. Upload one or more PDF documents.
2. Ask natural language questions about the document content.
3. Receive relevant, accurate answers based on the PDF’s text.
- By converting document text into embeddings, storing them in a FAISS vector index, and using Azure’s powerful AI models (including text embedding and GPT-4o chat), the system provides a scalable and intelligent solution for enterprise document search and understanding.
- Implementaion steps are in rag based solution using azure.pdf
